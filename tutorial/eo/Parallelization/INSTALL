How to install EoMPI
====================

Install OpenMpi
---------------

1) Download OpenMPI on their website or with the following command:

    wget http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.6/downloads/openmpi-1.6.tar.bz2

2) Untar the downloaded archive in a directory and change working directory to there:

    tar -xvjf openmpi*.tar.bz2
    cd openmpi-X.Y

3) Use configuration script to indicate in which directory OpenMPI should be installed, and other options:

Simplest configuration:
    ./configure --prefix=/home/`whoami`/openmpi/

Only static libraries:
    ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared

Only static libraries, with prefix, disable build for Fortran77 and Fortran90, add support for SGE:
    ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared --prefix=/home/`whoami`/openmpi/ --disable-mpi-f77 --disable-mpi-f90 --with-sge

Other options are available in the README file.

4) Make it and install:

In sequential:
    make all install

Or in parallel:
    make -j 2 all
    make install

5) Try to compile and run the sample program:

    ~/openmpi/bin/mpicxx -o sample mpi.c
    ~/openmpi/bin/mpirun -np 3 ./sample

Configure EO to use MPI
-----------------------

You only need to configure eo-conf.cmake so as to use MPI :

1) Put the WITH_MPI boolean to true:

    SET(WITH_MPI TRUE CACHE BOOL "Use mpi ?" FORCE)

2) Indicate in which directories you have installed openmpi:

    SET(MPI_DIR "/where/did/you/install/openmpi" CACHE PATH "OpenMPI directory" FORCE)

3) Recompile eo:

    ./distclean
    ./build_gcc_linux_release.sh

4) If you meet any issue, don't hesitate to contact the EO mailing list:

    eodev-main@lists.sourceforge.net
