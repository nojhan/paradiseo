### This Makefile is part of the tutorial of the EO library
# Unlike other Makefiles in EO, it is not using the automake/autoconf
# so that it stays easy to understant (you are in the tutorial, remember!)
# MS, Oct. 2002

# if you use this Makefile as a starting point for another application
# you might need to modify the following
DIR_EO = ../../src

.SUFFIXES: .cpp

# Warning: $(CXX) in Linux (RedHat and Mandrake at least) is g++
# However, if you are using this Makefile within xemacs,
# and have problems with the interpretation of the output (and its colors)
# then you should use c++ instead (make CXX=c++ will do)
