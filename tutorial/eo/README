Eo Tutorial - corresponding to EO version 0.9.1+

To start the tutorial, read index.html in your favorite browser.

Many things are missing, including many solutions for the exercises,
the introduction to EC and most of the Component-based pages.
More important, all examples of this tutorial have only been tested
on a Linux computer, and the Makefile will not work with MS-Windows
systems. Any help is welcome!

Be patient ...
