This Templates directory contains template files of an EO project and
a script createEOproject.sh to create a complete new EO project.

The template requires a complete installation of EO, that is, you must
have run "make install" in the build-directory.

In particular, the C++ compiler must also know how to find the EO
include files and the linker must find the EO libraries. Most
probably, that means that you have to set the variables
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH, i.e. for a standard installation
and using tcsh:
  setenv CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH /usr/local/include/eo:"$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
  setenv LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib:"$LIBRARY_PATH"

When running bash, use this:
  export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include/eo:"$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
  export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:"$LIBRARY_PATH"


You can freely move the created project around. However, whenever you
change the location of the source- or build-directories, you need to
run
  touch configure.ac && autoreconf
in the source-directory and
  make
in the build-directory (which might or might not be the same for you).


When you add additional source files to the project, simply add them
to the <myproj>_SOURCES variable in src/Makefile.am. Header files
should be added to noinst_HEADERS.


See README.manual for more details.
