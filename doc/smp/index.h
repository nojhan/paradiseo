@section Introduction

ParadisEO-SMP for Symmetric MultiProcessing or Shared Memory Parallelism is a module for multicores computations on several algorithms proposed by ParadiseEO. By simply wrapping the algorithms, it allows you to refer only to the API of your algorithm instead of learning a new one.

Different parallelism models are available such as the Master / Slaves Model or the Island Model.
