/**
 * To explore the evolvability of solutions in a neutral networks:
 *   Perform a random neutral walk based on the neighborhood,
 *   The measures of evolvability of solutions are collected during the random neutral walk
 *   The distribution and autocorrelation can be computed from the serie of values
 *
 *    Informations collected:
 *         - the current solution of the walk
 *         - the distance from the starting solution
 *         - the minimal fitness in the neighborhood
 *         - the average fitness
 *         - the standard deviation of the fitness
 *         - the maximal fitness
 *         - the size of the neighborhood
 *         - the number of neighbors with lower fitness
 *         - the number of neighbors with equal fitness (neutral degree)
 *         - the number of neighbors with higher fitness
