/**
 * @brief Registers a group of statistics, each statistic corresponding to user, system and wallclock times distribution.
 *
 * This class helps the user to measure time in different parts of an application. A name is associated to a statistic,
 * on each call to start() and stop() for this name, a new number is added to the statistic, for each of the three
 * measured times.
 *
 * The statistics are only registered if the option "--parallelized-do-measure" is set to true, which can be checked
 * thanks to global object eo::parallel.
 *
 * This shows how the eoTimerStat can be used :
 * @code
 * eoTimerStat timerStat;
 * timerStat.start("first_point");
 * for( int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i )
 * {
 *   timerStat.start("single_computation");
 *   single_computation( i );
 *   timerStat.stop("single_computation");
 * }
 * // After this loop, timerStat contains a statistic of key "single_computation" which contains 1000 measures for
 * // each type of time.
 * timerStat.stop("first_point");
 * // After this line, timerStat contains another statistic of key "first_point" which counted the duration of the
 * // whole loop.
 *
 * int singleComputationUsertimeMean = 0;
 * for( int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i )
 * {
 *      singleComputationUsertimeMean += timerStat.stats()["single_computation"].utime[i];
 * }
 * std::cout << "Mean of user time spent in single computation: " << singleComputationUsertimeMean / 1000. << std::endl;
 * @endcode
 *
 * When using MPI, these statistics can be readily be serialized, so as to be sent over a network, for instance.
 *
 * Implementation details: this eoTimerStat is in fact a map of strings (key) / Stat (value). Stat is an internal
 * structure directly defined in the class, which contains three vectors modeling the distributions of the different
 * types of elapsed times. Another map of strings (key) / eoTimer (value) allows to effectively retrieve the different
 * times. The struct Stat will be exposed to client, which will use its members ; however,
 * the client doesn't have anything to do directly with the timer, that's why the two maps are splitted.
