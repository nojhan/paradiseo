This directory contains:

- some standard EO source files, named eoXXXXX, that define objects
for the eoBit<FitT> representation (bitstrings).

- some make_XXX.cpp files that are instanciations for EO bitstrings
(eoBit<double> AND eoBit<eoMinimizingFitness>) of the tempatized code
that is defined in the EO src/do dir.
This MK's trick allows to actually compile all these bits in a library
(eolibga.a) and to only recompile the bits you need for your own
(bitstring!) application.
@see src/do/make_XXX.h files, and test/t-eoGA.cpp for an example use.

Note:
Also are *defined* here two representation dependent make_XXX.h files
(together with their instanciations in make_XXX.cpp), namely the ones
that constructs the EOType initializer (make_genotype.h) and the one
that buils up the operators (make_op.h).
