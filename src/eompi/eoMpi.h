    /**
     * @brief MPI parallelization helpers for EO.
     *
     * This namespace contains parallelization functions which help to parallelize computations in EO. It is based on a
     * generic algorithm, which is then customized with functors, corresponding to the algorithm main steps. These
     * computations are centralized, i.e there is one central host whose role is to handle the steps of the algorithm ;
     * we call it the "master". The other hosts just have to perform a "dummy" computation, which may be any kind of
     * processing ; we call them, the "slaves", or less pejoratively, the "workers". Workers can communicate to each
     * other, but they receive their orders from the Master and send him back some results. A worker can also be the
     * master of a different parallelization process, as soon as it is a part of its work. Machines of the network, also
     * called hosts, are identified by an unique number: their rank. At any time during the execution of the program,
     * all the hosts know the total number of hosts.
     *
     * A parallelized Job is a set of tasks which are independant (i.e can be executed in random order without
     * modifiying the result) and take a data input and compute a data output to be sent to the Master. The data can be
     * of any type, however they have to be serialized to be sent over a network. It is sufficient that they can be
     * serialized through boost.
     *
     * @todo For serialization purposes, don't depend upon boost. It would be easy to use only eoserial and send strings
     * via mpi.
     *
     * The main steps of the algorithm are the following:
     * - For the master:
     *      - Have we done with the treatment we are doing ?
     *      - If this is the case, we can quit.
     *      - Otherwise, send an input data to some available worker.
     *      - If there's no available worker, wait for a worker to be free.
     *      - When receiving the response, handle it (eventually compute something on the output data, store it...).
     *      - Go back to the first step.
     * - For the worker, it is even easier:
     *      - Wait for an order.
     *      - If there's nothing to do, just quit.
     *      - Otherwise, eventually retrieve data and do the work.
     *      - Go back to the first step.
     *
     * There is of course some network adjustements to do and precisions to give there, but the main ideas are present. As the
     * job is fully centralized, this is the master who tells the workers when to quit and when to work.
     *
     * The idea behind these MPI helpers is to be the most generic possible. If we look back at the steps of the
     * algorithm, we found that the steps can be splitted into 2 parts: the first consists in the steps of any
     * parallelization algorithm and the other consists in the specific parts of the algorithm. Ideally, the user should
     * just have to implement the specific parts of the algorithm. We identified these parts to be:
     * - For the master:
     *      - What does mean to have terminated ? There are only two alternatives, in our binary world: either it is
     *      terminated, or it is not. Hence we only need a function returning a boolean to know if we're done with the
     *      computation : we'll call it IsFinished.
     *      - What do we have to do when we send a task ? We don't have any a priori on the form of the sent data, or
     *      the number of sent data. Moreover, as the tasks are all independant, we don't care of who will do the
     *      computation, as soon as it's done. Knowing the rank of the worker will be sufficient to send him data. We
     *      have identified another function, taking a single argument which is the rank of the worker: we'll call it
     *      SendTask.
     *      - What do we have to do when we receive a response from a worker ? One more time, we don't know which form
     *      or structure can have the receive data, only the user can know. Also we let the user the charge to retrieve
     *      the data ; he just has to know from who the master will retrieve the data. Here is another function, taking
     *      a rank (the sender's one) as a function argument : this will be HandleResponse.
     * - For the worker:
     *      - What is the processing ? It can have any nature. We just need to be sure that a data is sent back to the
     *      master, but it seems difficult to check that: it will be the role of the user to assert that data is sent by
     *      the worker at the end of an execution. We've got identified our last function: ProcessTask.
     *
     * In term of implementation, it would be annoying to have only abstract classes with these 4 methods to implement. It
     * would mean that if you want to alter just one of these 4 functions, you have to implement a new sub class, with a
     * new constructor which could have the same signature. Besides, this fashion doesn't allow you to add dynamic
     * functionalities, using the design pattern Decorator for instance, without implement a class for each type of
     * decoration you want to add. For these reasons, we decided to transform function into functors ; the user can then
     * wrap the existing, basic comportments into more sophisticated computations, whenever he wants, and without the
     * notion of order. We retrieve here the power of extension given by the design pattern Decorator.
     *
     * Our 4 functors could have a big amount of data in common (see eoParallelApply to have an idea).
     * So as to make it easy for the user to implement these 4 functors, we consider that these functors
     * have to share a common data structure. This data structure is referenced (as a pointer) in the 4 functors, so the
     * user doesn't need to pass a lot of parameters to each functor constructor.
     *
     * There are two kinds of jobs:
     * - The job which are launched a fixed and well known amount of times, i.e both master and workers know how many
     *   times they will be launched. They are "one shot jobs".
     * - The job which are launched an unknown amount of times, for instance embedded in a while loop for which we don't
     *   know the amount of repetitions (typically, eoEasyEA loop is a good example, as we don't know the continuator
     *   condition). They are called "multi job".
     * As the master tells the workers to quit, we have to differentiate these two kinds of jobs. When the job is of the
     * kind "multi job", the workers would have to perform a while(true) loop so as to receive the orders ; but even if
     * the master tells them to quit, they would begin another job and wait for another order, while the master would
     * have quit: this would cause a deadlock and workers processes would be blocked, waiting for an order.

         * We can add a wrapper at initialization or at any time when executing the program.
         *
         * According to RAII, the boolean needDelete helps to know if we have to use the operator delete on the wrapper
         * or not. Hence, if any functor is wrapped, user has just to put this boolean to true, to indicate to wrapper
         * that it should call delete. This allows to mix wrapper initialized in the heap (with new) or in the stack.
         *
         * @param JobData a Data type, which can have any form. It can a struct, a single int, anything.
         *
         * @param Wrapped the type of the functor, which will be stored as a pointer under the name _wrapped.
         * This allows to wrap directly the functor in functors of the same type
         * here, instead of dealing with SharedDataFunction* that we would have to cast all the time.
         * Doing also allows to handle the wrapped functor as the functor we're writing, when coding the wrappers,
         * instead of doing some static_cast. For instance, if there are 2 functors subclasses, fA and fB, fA
         * implementing doFa() and fB implementing doFb(), we could have the following code:
         * @code
         * struct fA_wrapper

         *   // some code
         *   void doFa()

         *      std::cout << "I'm a fA wrapper!" << std::endl;
         *      // if we didn't have the second template parameter, but a SharedDataFunction, we would have to do this:
         *      static_cast<fA*>(_wrapped)->doFa();
         *      // do other things (it's a wrapper)
