  @defgroup Algorithms Algorithms

  In EDO, as in EO, an algorithm is a functor that takes one or several
  solutions to an optimization problem as arguments, and iteratively modify
  them with the help of operators.It differs from a canonical EO algorithm
  because it is templatized on a edoDistrib rather than just an EOT.
