/** Thanks to MS/VC++, eoParam mechanism is unable to handle std::vectors of stats.
This snippet is a workaround:
This class will "print" a whole population into a std::string - that you can later
send to any stream
This is the plain version - see eoPopString for the Sorted version

Note: this Stat should probably be used only within eoStdOutMonitor, and not
inside an eoFileMonitor, as the eoState construct will work much better there.
