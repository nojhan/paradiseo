Introduction</a></h2>
ParadisEO-MOEO is a white-box object-oriented generic framework dedicated to the flexible design of evolutionary multi-objective algorithms. This paradigm-free software embeds some features and techniques for Pareto-based resolution and aims to provide a set of classes allowing to ease and speed up the development of computationally efficient programs. It is based on a clear conceptual distinction between the solution methods and the multi-objective problems they are intended to solve. This separation confers a maximum design and code reuse. ParadisEO-MOEO provides a broad range of archive-related features (such as elitism or performance metrics) and the most common Pareto-based fitness assignment strategies (MOGA, NSGA, SPEA, IBEA and more). Furthermore, parallel and distributed models as well as hybridization mechanisms can be applied to an algorithm designed within ParadisEO-MOEO using the whole version of ParadisEO.<h2><a class="anchor" name="tutorials">
