\hypertarget{t-eo_8cpp-example}{}\doxysection{t-\/eo.\+cpp}
\mbox{\hyperlink{class_e_o}{EO}} is the base class for objects with a fitness.

Those evolvable objects are the subjects of evolution. E\+Os have only got a fitness, which at the same time needs to be only an object with the operation less than ($<$) defined. Fitness says how good is the object; evolution or change of these objects is left to the genetic operators.

A fitness less than another means a worse fitness, in whatever the context; thus, fitness is always maximized; although it can be minimized with a proper definition of the $<$ operator.

A fitness can be invalid if undefined, trying to read an invalid fitness will raise an error. \mbox{\hyperlink{group___operators}{Evolutionary Operators}} that effectively modify \mbox{\hyperlink{class_e_o}{EO}} objects must invalidate them.

The fitness object must have, besides an void ctor, a copy ctor.
