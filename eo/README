                      BUILDING EO
==================================================================
The basic installation procedure goes the following:

Go to your build-directory and run 
    $(SRCDIR)/configure
    make
    make check
    make install
where $(SRCDIR) is the top-level source directory of EO, i.e. where
the sources where unpacked.

See $(SRCDIR)/configure for possible options. You can specify to not
build example applications, the tutorial, or to build the ParadisEO
tutorial. You may also change the installation directory that way.

Now you should probably go to the tutorial and start learning about EO
features and programming.


In case of problems, you can read the INSTALL file - but remember this
is a standard installation file from GNU and that it contains nothing
specific about EO.


===================================================================
                       DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
===================================================================
After unpacking the archive file, you should end up with the following
structure:

.../                            the MAIN EO dir, created when unpacking
   |
   +-- src                    SOURCE dir. Contains most EO .h files
   |   |
   |   +- utils          general utilities (e.g. RNG-related source files)
   |   |
   |   +- ga             bistring-genotypes source files
   |   |
   |   +- es             real-valued-genotypes source files  
   |   |
   |   +- gp             Genetic Programming source files
   |   |
   |   +- obsolete       files from old versions - for upward compatibility
   |
   |
   |
   +-- tutorial               TUTORIAL dir (indeed :-)
   |   |

   | 
   |
   |

   |   |
   |   +- html             HTML files - start at index.html (see also tutorial)

   |   |
   |   +- gprop            GA/backpropagation for neural nets 
   |   |
   |   +- mastermind       the wellknown MasterMind game

              NOTES
=================================================================== if
you extracted a fresh snapshot from the cvs-repository, remember to
run
    ./autogen.sh
in the source-directory before building the libraries.
