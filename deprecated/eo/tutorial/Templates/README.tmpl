This is an autogenerated EO project. It was (most probably) generated
using the createEOproject.sh script in the
<eo-dir>/tutorial/Templates directory.

The project has a complete build-infrastructure based on
automake/autoconf. You can simply run "make" in this directory to have
the program compiled. The executable build will be in src/. In case of
problem during this step, please read the README file in the
...eo-dir/tutorial/Templates directory.

After creation, the project should compile nicely - but of course the
resulting program does noting at all but print a few silly lines.

Fill in the marked code-snippets in the files in src/ and you have a
complete EA project (detailed explanations in EO Tutorial - Lesson 5).

Enjoy!


For details, for example on moving your project around or adding new
files, see <eo-dir>/tutorial/Templates/README.
