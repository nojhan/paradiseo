Welcome to EO, the Evolving Objects library.

The latest news about EO can be found on the sourceforge repository at
    http://eodev.sourceforge.net/

In case of any problem, please e-mail us at
    eodev-main@lists.sourceforge.net

To get started, take a look at the tutorial, starting with
    ./tutorial/html/eoTutorial.html

The easiest way to start programming a new genome with all EO
evolution engines handy is to create a new standalone EO project from
the tutorial/Templates/ directory. Read Lesson 5 of the tutorial for
an introduction ;)


==================================================================
		      BUILDING EO
==================================================================
The basic installation procedure goes the following:

Go to the "eo/" and run one of the "build_*" script.Â 

Using the "build_gcc_linux_release" script is generally what you want. The
binaries are then located in the "release/" directory.

Now you should probably go to the tutorial and start learning about EO
features and programming.

In case of problems or if you want advanced options, you can read the INSTALL file.

===================================================================
		       DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
===================================================================
After unpacking the archive file, you should end up with the following
structure:

.../                            the MAIN EO dir, created when unpacking

   |   +- ga             bistring-genotypes source files
   |   |
   |   +- es             real-valued-genotypes source files
   |   |
   |   +- gp             Genetic Programming source files
   |   |
   |   +- obsolete       files from old versions - for upward compatibility
   |

   |
   +-- tutorial               TUTORIAL dir (indeed :-)
