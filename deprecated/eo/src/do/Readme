This directory contains templatized code that is supposed to be
instanciated and compiled in an actual library for every type of EOT

The user can then modify and recompile only the part he/she wishes to
change (as in any library!).

See in EO src/ga dir the corresponding .cpp files, that simply instanciate
the functions here for eoBit<double> AND eoBit<eoMinimizingFitness>
and in EO test dir the t-eoGA.cpp file that is a sample program that uses
the whole facility.

All make_XXX.h file define some parser-based constructions of basic
Evolutionary Algorithms components, using state-based memory management
(see in src/utils dir, or read the tutorial).

In this src/do dir, the following ***representation indedendent*** code
is defined

make_algo_scalar.h     The selection/replacement for scalar fitnesses
make_checkpoint.h      The output facilities
make_continue.h        The stpping criteria
make_pop.h             Init of the population (from an EOT initializer)
make_run.h             Run the algorithm

See also (NOW MOVED TO util DIR, as it was useful everywhere)
make_help.cpp          Help on demand (+ status file)

Note:
-----
two additional make_XXX.h files need to be defined for each representation

make_genotype.h        Builds an initializer for the corresponding EOType
make_op.h              Builds a general Operator to be used in the algo
