/** A helper class, to determine a number of individuals from another one
 *  Typically, is used in selection / replacement procedures, e.g.
 *             the number of offspring from the number of parents, or
 *             the number of survivors for an eoReduce functor, ...
 *
 * Such construct is very useful because in some cases you might not know the
 * population size that will enter the replacement. For instance, you
 * cannot simply have a pre-computed (double) rate of 1/popSize
 * if you want to select or kill just 1 guy. Using an eoHowMany
 * allows one to modify the population size without touching anything else.
 *
 * There are 4 possible way to compute the return value from the argument:
 *    - an absolute POSITIVE integer  --> return it (regardless of popsize)
 *    - a POSITIVE rate               -->  return rate*popSize
 *    - an absolute NEGATIVE integer  --> return popsize-rate (if positive)
 *    - a NEGATIVE rate in [-1,0]     --> store and use 1-|rate| (positive)
 * Note that a negative rate should be have been necessary because a rate is
 * relative, but it is there for consistency reasons - and because it
 * is needed in <a href="classeo_g3_replacement_h-source.html">eoG3Replacement</a>
 *
 * It has 2 private members, a double and an integer to cover all cases
 *
 * Example use: in <a href="class_eogeneralbreeder.html">eoGeneralBreeder.h</a>
 * Example reading from parser: in
 *         <a href="make_algo_scalar_h-source.html">do/make_algo_scalar.h line 141</a>

 * MS 10/04/2002:
 *    Added the possibility to have a negative number -
 *        when treated as a number: returns then (size - count)
 *    Should not modify anything when a positive number is passed in the ctor
 *
 * MS 20/06/2002:
 *    Added the negative rate and the operator-() (for
 *    eoG3Repalcement)
 *
 * It is an eoPersistent because we need to be able to use eoParamValue<eoHowMany>
 *
