    Note that there is no equivalent to eoRealVectorBounds for vector of integers
    
    In file eo, I have added the 2 includes of eoRealBounds.h and eoIntBounds.h

    After indoduction of paradisEO, eoEaseyEA was a subclass of class eoPopAlgo
    and not eoAlgo.
    I don't have time to investigate, so I went back to a subclass of eoAlgo.
    We'll sort that out later (after EuroGP I guess).

    I have changed all calls to use an eoParser rather than an eoParameterLoader
    This is required if you want to use the method getParamWithLongName that allows
    one to get a value of a parameter read somewhere else.
    After changing 3 calls due to that, I decided to change ALL calls within
    the make_xxx functions

    Corrected a bug in the selector and replacement tournamemt parameter reading:
    if you did not give the tournament sizes, the program either crashed or went
    in some endless loop.
    I also simplified the reading of those eoParamPram parameters!

    Updated makefile.am such that "make check" will run all test programs. Fixed
    a number of erronuous return values that made the script fail. What's left
    is let Marc clean up the mess he made with t-eoReal and t-eoRealAllESAllAgain

    Added method
    eoParam* getParamWithLongName(std::string _name);
    so now you can get a parameter in another place than where it was defined
    just by giving its name

    the name of the eoGpDepthInitializer class (initializer for

    Adding eoPopEvalFunc, that handles evaluation globally: it receives
    two populations, parents and offspring, and does whatever necessary.
    The subclass eoPopLoopEval does the simple loop on the offspring.
    
    eoEasyEA was subsequently modified to handle an eoPopEval passed in Ctor,
    but also to encapsulate an eoEvalFunc into an eoPopLoopEval tranparently.

Author: evomarc <evomarc>
Date:   Tue Jul 3 12:56:44 2001 +0000

    Added the eoPopEvalFunc class: gets the full parents + offspring populations
    in order to evaluate them.
    Modified eoEaseyEA accordingly - you can either pass an eoEvalFunc, as
    before (it is then encapsulated into an eoPopLoopEval that does the good
    old loop on the offspring - or directly pass a full eoPopEvalFunc
    
    Small modification also in make_op_es -> keyword "none" is now recognized
    for one of the crossover of either object variables or stdev's

    base documentation written for:
    * eoParseTree
    * eoGpDepthInitializer

    choose the type of gentype at run-time (from existing types, of course!)

    a copy into each representation dir!).

    Some changes in names, before too many users have to modify their code :-)
    Changed ga.h in src/ga into make_ga.h (was ambiguous with src/ga.h)
    Chenged the interface of make_genotype - now templatized by the EOT
    and not the fitness - this is mandatory for ES genoptypes as it allows to
    choose the type of gentype at run-time (from existing types, of course!)

    The new libga

    Modified printOn so that parameters that are not set explicitely by the user

    in the base class eoParameterLoader) method isItThere.

Author: evomarc <evomarc>
Date:   Tue Apr 10 15:08:09 2001 +0000

    Added the pure virtual isItThere method in base class eoParameterLoader
    Also made the corresponding isItThere method in eoParser public.
    This allows one to test if the user did actually input a given parameter
    and thus not to write it in the output if not - as we want the output
    of printOn to be "as identical as possible" to the actual user input

    Changed the populator to be a) more efficient and b) more useable
    
    It is no longer derived from eoPop, it now gets a destination population.
    This saves a lot of copying. The semantics has changed a little as well. It is
    now an _infinite_ iterator. operator++ will *not* dispense new individuals, but
    will merely stay at the end. To get a new indy, use operator*() as before.
    
    eoEasyEA now checks the checkpoint *after* making a generation and clears the offspring
    eoGeneralBreeder is changed to reflect the changes in eoPopulator
    eoSequentialSelect now uses setup() rather than init()

    Modified eoInit so that it would use the eoRndGenerator base class.
    To be able to use the primitive std::generate function, added a
    set of wrappers in eoSTLFunctor.h that have the copy semantics most
    STL functions expect (namely pass-by-value rather then pass-by-reference).

    exceptions were not being caught.

    eoVector is back (eoFixedLength and eoVariableLength are gone)
    
    Also: introducing eoRndGenerators.h for eoRndGenerator derived classes:
    
      eoNormalGenerator
      eoUniformGenerator
      eoBooleanGenerator
      eoNegExpGenerator
    
    Note the suffix that are added to aid in determining what these classes do

    Changed the signature of eoMon, eoBin and eoQuadOp to return a bool,
    without invalidating fitness. Added a set of invalidators to take over
    that job (see for instance eoSGA and eoSGATransform how this can transparantly used)
    
    Derived eoState from eoFunctorStore (for convenience, from a design perspective this may sound wrong)
    
    Added a wrap_op function that does the wrapping for you (see eoOpContainer how this made this functor
    exceedingly less hairy). Checked all the tests removed the eoGeneric*Op family (not needed anymore)
    and of course changed all the operators to reflect the change (and found a few that didn't
    invalidate the fitness, thus really pointing out the advantage of the current approach)

    fixed a bug: the parser now correctly parses parameters of the form
    
    -Pvalue
    
    This will now produce 'value'. The buggy parser would parse 'alue' here. I am truly and deeply
    ashamed to have created such an off-by-one error.
    
    Marc assumed this was wanted behaviour (so that it should read: -P=value)
    I must admit that this is a logical conclusion, though it was merely a side-effect
    of the error. To not force Marc to rewrite the tutorial and his way of working with
    EO, I decided to make a feature out of the bug, so that now the parser will parse:
    
    -Pvalue
    -P=value
    
    and of course the true and blue:
    
    -Parameter=value
    
    I will now go and check if I sent out some crappy papers caused by this bug (as I've been using eo!)

    Just an update

Author: maartenkeijzer <maartenkeijzer>
Date:   Mon Feb 12 13:58:51 2001 +0000

    Ok, updated the Makefile.am again to use the
    
    make check
    
    Command I picked up in the automake documentation (RTFM, you know)
    
    Tagged a lot of header functions in the GnuPlot files with 'inline',
    so they can be used from more than one sourcefile.
    
    Ok, now the interesting news. Started a new library libga (not to be confused
    with Matthew's GaLib). Here I suggest we put a fairly complete and configurable
    genetic algorithm. Just to see how far we can stretch ourselves and also to have
    a GA-componenent that can be used in other applications without having to rebuild
    the entire thing. test/t-eoGA.cpp tests this library

    run_tests is expanded to run everything (but only once yet, will have
    to address this later).
    t-eoSymreg is build to run for just a few generations, otherwise testing
    it would be an excercise in patience.

    The BIG change of general operator interface
    I also changed
      - the eoQuadratic into eoQuad (as dicussed with Maarten)
      - the eoBin into eoBit, with more appropriate names for the "binary"
        operators (that can be unary!) as no one protested when I posted on

    Added the monitoring facilities for snapshots (i.e. generating and plotting a new file

    angemented every generation).
    This lead to a number of modifications in many files in utils dir
    
    But now we can watch on-line

    A few details in the comments

Author: evomarc <evomarc>
Date:   Tue Jan 2 07:03:57 2001 +0000

    I had to change the whole way the parameters are read, because EGCS did not
    allow the nice constructs I had imagined (and compiled with g++)
    - I removed the createParam method in Parser class - that was creating the parameters
      on the heap. Not allowed to have a templatized method ???
    - I removed the subroutine read_param in SecondBitEA, as you need to create
      permanent parameters (eoParser only holds references), and egcs did not allow
      to create them by reference, i.e. in the line
      eoValueParam<xxx> & blablaParam(...);
    
    So now everything is done in the main_function, and 3 lines are needed to create
    and read every paramter (sigh ...)

Author: evomarc <evomarc>
Date:   Tue Dec 19 18:41:19 2000 +0000

    THe big eoReplacement update:
    The interface for eoReplacement is now eoPop<EOT>&, eoPop<EOT>&
    (i.e. no const) and the result must be in the first argument in the end.
    
    Hence it is possible to do SSGA and all intermediate replacmeent procedures
    
    The classes derived from eoMergeReduce.h are now in a separate file
    The SSGA-like replcaement procedures are in eoReduceMerge.h

Date:   Mon Dec 4 06:58:43 2000 +0000

    Added the lastCall construct: if the stopping condition becomes true in eoCheckPoint,
          a method called lastCall is called for everything contained in that checkpoint
          (stats, updaters and monitors). This can be extremely useful
          - for stateSavers (see below)
          - for monitoring things like rates of success of operators, where what you
            are interested in is the final result only.
    Added of course a virtual method lastCall that does nothing by default in classes
          eoBaseStat, eoBaseSortedStat, eoUpdater and eoMonitor
    Added a boolean to control the save of the state in method eoCountedStateSaver::lastCall
          so you can ask that the state is saved at final population, whatever happens.
          I also added the corresponding constructor to take this into account.
