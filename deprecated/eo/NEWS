* current version

* release 1.2  (16. May. 2011)
  - fixed the incremental allocation issue in variation operators which were
    taking too much time for big population sizes
  - new class eoParallel enabling parallelization in EO using OpenMP. At this
    time, it only concerns the evaluation operator, for advanced details go to
    the file test/t-eoParallel.cpp. The default parallelization mode is off, to
    switch it on, see the parameters prefixed by --parallelize-* 
  - pyeo compatible with the last version of Boost and Python libraries
  - script installing EO manually in using symbolic links
  - evaluators that throw an exception if a maximum time has been reached 
    (wallclock and CPU user time for POSIX systems), independently of the number of generations
  - merged parser and parser-logger
  - some bugfixes for windows systems

* release 1.1 (8. Nov. 2010)
  - provide cmake build system, remove the old autotools one
  - package generation system
  - GCC 4.3 compatibility
  - new versatile log system with several nested verbose levels
  - classes using intern verbose parameters marked as deprecated, please update your code accordingly if you use one of the following files:
	eo/src/eoCombinedInit.h
	eo/src/eoGenContinue.h
	eo/src/eoProportionalCombinedOp.h
	eo/src/utils/eoData.h
	eo/src/utils/eoStdoutMonitor.h
  - an evaluator that throw an exception if a maximum eval numbers has been reached, independently of the number of generations
  - new monitor that can write on any ostream
  - new continuator that can catch POSIX system user signals
  - dual fitness class to handle feasibility of individual with guarantee that feasible fitness will always be better than unfeasible one
  - feasible fitness ratio stat
  - interquartile range stat
  - average size of individuals stat
  - uniform(min,max) random function
  - compatibility macros for compiling paradiseo with CUDACC
  - removed old multi-objective classes, deprecated by the Paradiseo-MOEO project
  - new website, switch from CVS to GIT, and a cool logo!

* release 1.0.1 (23. Jan. 2006)
  - Templates/ improvements

* release 1.0 (29. Dec. 2006)
  - Implement CMA-ES.
  - Update introductory pages of documentation and webpage.
  - Add Microsoft Visual C++ project support files (for Visual Studio 2003 and 2005)
  - Upgrade Teamplates/ script to create a complete standalone EO project (using autotools)
  - Remove support for pre-standard C++ compiler (i.e. gcc-2.x), which allows to
    clean up the code considerably.
    Assume availability of sstream and limits.

* release 0.9.3z.1 (1. Oct. 2005)
  - Support gcc-3.4 and gcc.4.x.
  - Provide full automake/autoconf/configure support.
